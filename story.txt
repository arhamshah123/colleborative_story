short story


Once upon a time, in a quiet village, lived a curious boy named Ayan.
He loved exploring the nearby forest, filled with ancient trees and hidden paths.
One sunny afternoon, he discovered a glowing stone under a mossy rock.
As he touched it, a soft voice whispered, “You’ve awakened the Forest Guardian.”
Suddenly, a small, glowing creature appeared, offering him a secret map.
The map led to a hidden waterfall that granted one wish to the pure of heart.
Ayan wished for peace and happiness for his village.
The next morning, the village woke to blooming fields and joyful laughter.
The stone lost its glow, its magic fulfilled, and Ayan kept the map as a memory.
He never spoke of it, but the village forever thrived, thanks to one brave boy.
